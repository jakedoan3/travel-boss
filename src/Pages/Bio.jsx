        Hey there! My name is Nicole Stacey, but friends call me Nicki. I have been a 'planner' all my life and would organize any reason to celebrate something since I was in middle school. Over the last 30+ years, I have helped create personalized travel and vacations for my own family, girls' weekends, excursions abroad, and several dozen trips to Disney World. I have a knack for finding one-of-a-kind experiences and have a great relationship with VRBO and AirBNB.
