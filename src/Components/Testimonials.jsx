          "Nicki has meticulously planned our annual girls' trip for the past 25
          years, 25 different locations, spanning coast to coast. We’ve seen
          city lights, remote hideaways, and everything in between. That's a
          wealth of experience that few can rival.
          <br />
          <br />
          But it's not just about the destinations; it's the delicate art of
          managing the diverse interests and personalities of 5-10 women. Nicki
          doesn't just strike a balance; she conjures a harmonious symphony of
          experiences, seamlessly weaving activities and relaxation into each
          trip.
          <br />
          <br />
          Choosing Nicki as your guide is an investment in a journey that's not
          just memorable, but flawless. With her at the helm, you can relinquish
          your travel worries and savor every moment of the adventure."

          "We contacted Nicki at TravelBoss to arrange a family reunion of 40+
          adults and children from around the United States. Two challenges
          presented themselves: 1) Where to host the event and 2) the entire
          family wanted to be in the same home. Nicki was more than capable of
          meeting these challenges and more. At various points in the planning
          stage, I admit I was skeptical, but Travel Boss said, “Trust the
          process, I got this.” She did and we were so pleased with the location
          as well as the home that accommodated us all. The Travel Boss fielded
          multiple emails with patience, professionalism, and provided clarity
          and reassurances.
          <br />
          <br />
          Nicki anticipated our needs before we thought of them: handicap
          parking, closing off sections of the home to provide safety for babies
          and toddlers, easy access to balconies, and finding an
          easy-to-navigate home for the blind). I recommend Travel Boss for any
          of your traveling plans."

          Ireland was amazing. She gave gentle prompts to encourage us to book
          our stays in a timely manner, and arranged for us to stay in 10
          different places across the country. When we had questions or concerns
          before and during the trip, she was able to troubleshoot and help us
          while abroad. We will definitely be calling TravelBoss again!"

          "Planning any trip, personal or professional, not only consumes time
          but also requires keen attention to detail to make the experience
          memorable. I collaborated with Nicki at TravelBoss to organize a trip
          to California wine country for a large group of women from a social
          club in Ohio. While all the ladies shared an interest in visiting
          Sonoma, their preferences for activities varied. This posed a
          challenge in coordinating a trip that needed to feel personal and
          special for each individual.
          <br />
          Nicki rose to the challenge! She secured an estate to accommodate our
          large party, identified vendors to support her proposed schedule, and
          even successfully gathered all seventeen of us in San Francisco in
          time for a lunch before heading into the countryside. <br />
          We appreciated the personalized itineraries that catered to everyone,
          ranging from group dinners, hiking, and yoga to smaller group tours of
          the many wineries by chartered vehicles or bicycle! From the moment
          the group arrived at the estate to the time we left for the airport,
          Nicki/[company name] went above and beyond to ensure a seamless and
          memorable experience for all!"
